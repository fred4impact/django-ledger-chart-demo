# DevSecOps for Django Ledger App: Security in CI/CD

This guide explains how to integrate security into your CI/CD pipeline for the Django Ledger app, focusing on best practices and recommended tools for DevSecOps. Each tool includes a brief explanation and how to implement it in GitHub Actions.

---

## Why DevSecOps?
DevSecOps integrates security practices into DevOps workflows, ensuring vulnerabilities are detected and remediated early in the software development lifecycle. This approach helps prevent security issues from reaching production.

---

## Key Security Tools & Practices for CI/CD

### 1. **Dependency Scanning**
- **Tool:** [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
- **Purpose:** Automatically scans your dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **GitHub Actions Integration:**
  - **Dependabot:** Native to GitHub; enable in repository settings or add `dependabot.yml`.
  - **Snyk:** Add a workflow step:
    ```yaml
    - name: Snyk Dependency Scan
      uses: snyk/actions/python@v1
      with:
        args: test
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
    ```

### 2. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
- **Tool:** [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) (for Python), [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/)
- **Purpose:** Analyzes source code for security issues (e.g., hardcoded secrets, unsafe code patterns).
- **GitHub Actions Integration:**
    ```yaml
    - name: Run Bandit (Python SAST)
      run: bandit -r django_ledger_starter/
    ```

### 3. **Secret Scanning**
- **Tool:** [GitHub Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning), [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog)
- **Purpose:** Detects accidental commits of secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- **GitHub Actions Integration:**
    ```yaml
    - name: TruffleHog Secret Scan
      uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
      with:
        scanArguments: --directory=.
    ```

### 4. **Container Image Scanning**
- **Tool:** [Aqua Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), [Anchore](https://anchore.com/)
- **Purpose:** Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities in OS packages and application dependencies.
- **GitHub Actions Integration:**
    ```yaml
    - name: Scan Docker image with Trivy
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        image-ref: your-image:latest
    ```

### 5. **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
- **Tool:** [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/), [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
- **Purpose:** Identifies vulnerable libraries and components in your project.
- **GitHub Actions Integration:**
    ```yaml
    - name: OWASP Dependency-Check
      uses: dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@main
      with:
        project: django-ledger
        path: .
    ```

### 6. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
- **Tool:** [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
- **Purpose:** Scans running applications for vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
- **GitHub Actions Integration:**
    ```yaml
    - name: OWASP ZAP Baseline Scan
      uses: zaproxy/action-baseline@v0.10.0
      with:
        target: 'http://localhost:8000'
    ```

## Example: Integrating Security Tools in GitHub Actions

Below is a sample workflow snippet showing how to add security steps to your pipeline:

```yaml
name: DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-test-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install bandit safety

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: python manage.py test

      - name: Static code analysis (Bandit)
        run: bandit -r django_ledger_project

      - name: Dependency vulnerability scan (Safety)
        run: safety check

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t ${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Scan Docker image (Trivy)
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.13.1
        with:
          image-ref: ${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Push Docker image
        run: docker push ${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}

  deploy:
    needs: build-test-scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up kubectl
        uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
        with:
          version: 'latest'

      - name: Set up GKE credentials
        uses: google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials@v2
        with:
          cluster_name: ${{ secrets.GKE_CLUSTER }}
          location: ${{ secrets.GKE_ZONE }}
          project_id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT }}

      - name: Deploy to GKE
        run: |
          kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
